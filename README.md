- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Even as simple as the UX/UI design may seems it was tough orangizing my thought on the way around it. Not much learnt on HTML, the HTML part was easy but the styling using CSS was a whole lot of trial and error, trying and retrying. 

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to continue on more CSS styling and bootstrap usage.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - This helped me for searching on various way to implement or go about a particular style reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Color hunt](https://www.colorhunt.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me in selecting colors for my website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
